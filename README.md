3. To do this, first open your XAMPP control panel and click start for both Apache and MySQL, then type 'localhost/phpmyadmin' in your browser's search bar (Google Chrome recommended)
4. Once you are redirected there will be an import option at the top of the page, click it and it will ask for a file. upload the file named 'apsle.sql' provided and your database will be created and populated with tables.
